# Megalodon

> A fork of the [official Mastodon Android app](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android) adding important features that are missing in the official app and possibly won’t ever be implemented, such as the federated timeline, unlisted posting, bookmarks and an image description viewer.

[![Download latest release](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=d92aad&label=download%20apk&query=%24.tag_name&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.github.com%2Frepos%2Fsk22%2Fmastodon-android-fork%2Freleases%2Flatest&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/sk22/megalodon/releases/latest/download/megalodon.apk)

## Key features

### **Unlisted posting**

**Allows you to post publicly without having your post show up in trends, hashtags or public timelines (i.e., in the tabs “Local”, “Community” and “Posts”).**

When posting with Unlisted visibility, your posts will still be publicly accessible in your profile. They will also be shown in people’s Home timelines, but only if they follow you or someone they follow reposted/replied to your post.
  
The Mastodon documentation has some more information about [Unlisted posting](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#unlisted) and [Public timelines](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/network/#timelines).

### **Federated timeline**

**This allows you to chronologically see all Public posts from people on all other Fediverse instances your home instance is connected to.**

Despite being one of the main features of federated social media, the Federated timeline wasn’t included in the official Mastodon app – supposedly, because this conflicts with Google’s safety requirements for apps on the Play Store.
  
That’s one of the reasons why choosing a small, **well-moderated instance is important**. Instance admins and moderators should always make sure to ban abusive users and stop federating with instances who platform them. On well-moderated instances, the Federated timeline can be a welcoming place to meet new people!

### **Image description viewer**

**Allows you to quickly check whether an image or video has an alternative text attached to it.**

This is important to **ensure the content you’re sharing is as accessible as possible** to people who can’t see the images and rely on software to read back the provided content descriptions. Thankfully, it’s quite common for people on the Fediverse to provide such alt texts, and hopefully things stay this way!

### **Pinning posts**

**This lets you can highlight important posts on your profile. A dedicated “Pinned” tab in people’s profiles shows all the posts they pinned.**

On the Fediverse, it’s quite common for people to pin posts they want others to read before following them. You can pin/unpin posts yourself by clicking the `⋯` button in the top right corner of your posts.

### **Bookmarks**

**They allow for quickly saving posts and viewing them through the Bookmarks button on the top right of your profile.**

To bookmark a post, press the button between the Favorite and Share buttons on the bottom of the post. Bookmarks are saved privately, so the post authors won’t know you saved their post – the list of bookmarked posts is only visible to you.

## Installation

**Press the download button above to download the APK. Open the downloaded file on your Android device to install it. Megalodon will automatically notify you about new updates inside the app.**

To install this app on your Android device, download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/sk22/megalodon/releases/latest/download/megalodon.apk) and open it. You might have to accept installing APK files from your browser when trying to install it. You can also take a look at all releases on the [Releases](https://github.com/sk22/megalodon/releases) page.

Megalodon makes use of [Mastodon for Android](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android)’s automatic update checker. Megalodon will check for new updates available on GitHub and offer to download and install them. You can also manually press “Check for updates” at the bottom of the settings page!

## Release variants

All downloads can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/sk22/megalodon/releases) page.

**`megalodon.apk`**

Variant with an integrated updater. If you download Megalodon from here (and not from an app store), just download the regular `megalodon.apk`.

**`upstream-1234abc.apk`**

This is an **unmodified version** of the official [Mastodon for Android](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android) app the respective Megalodon release is based on. Should you find any bugs in Megalodon (which you will), try to see if it occurs with this variant, too. The last 7 digits of the file name are important to know which version of the official app you're using.

<!-- **`megalodon-fdroid.apk`**

Variant without the integrated updater. This is the variant to be published to F-Droid.org where an integrated updater is not necessary. -->
